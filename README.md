My solutions to the advent of code puzzles: http://adventofcode.com

This repository has migrated to [Pijul nest](https://nest.pijul.com/quickdudley/adventofcode):
additional solutions might eventually be mirrored here.

## Additional notes

1. I have no intention of doing these every day until finished.
2. I will not be using the same language for every puzzle.
3. There are a few languages I'm interested in trying but have not used before.
Some of these will make an appearance in this repository.
